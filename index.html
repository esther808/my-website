        <p>Hello! My name is Esther Ho, and I am a third year Computer Science and Marketing Analytics major, I am passionate 
          about technology, programming, and Asian culture. I am currently the Asian American Heritage Month Co-Chair and a 
          part of Sigma Psi Zeta Sorority. As a part of these organizations I have been able to plan over 20 events and bring
           in Grentperez! He was a very chill guy that was down to Earth. I've had a lot of fun being able to plan all these events 
           exploring Asian American culture. Academics wise, I cam into Northeastern and settled on Computer Science and Marketing 
           Analytics as I am a person that loves building and creating things. Also understanding human behavior and how we perceive 
           different things, explaining my business concentration. I have been thinking about adding an additional minor to 
           my degree or another business concentration, but I am currently unsure of what I would add. I was interested in supply chain
           management or maybe management information systems because those two are more directly related to technology. I did my 
           first co-op at Wayfair on their Field Enablement Team! There I did a lot of analytics work for my team and built dashboards for use by the team.
